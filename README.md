# YOLOv7.jl

This package is a Julia version of the YOLOv7 model based on the [original author implementation in PyTorch](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7).

## Intitial Release
Right now we already have some working code loading the weights from the pretrained models. Until the beggining of March we will release some examples of how to load, infere and train the models.
